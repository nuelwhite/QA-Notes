Kickstarting the QA Essentials Series! ðŸš€ 

Welcome to Day 1 of our 30-day journey into posting software quality assurance essentials

QA is often misunderstood as just 'testing,' but itâ€™s so much more. It ensures that every product meets high-quality standards and delivers value to users. 

QA is the process of evaluating a softwareâ€™s quality, functionality, and performance to ensure that it meets the user requirements and expectations.

Software Quality Assurance (QA) isnâ€™t just about finding bugs; itâ€™s about delivering quality from the start. QA focuses on processes to prevent defects, while testing identifies issues in the product. Together, they ensure reliability and value for users.

Hereâ€™s the distinction: 
-  QA focuses on preventing defects by improving processes. 
- Testing identifies defects by assessing the product. 

Together, they form the backbone of reliable software delivery. 

Over the next 30 days, Iâ€™ll share QA essentials to help you level up your understanding and application of quality assurance practices. 
Stay tuned for tomorrowâ€™s post on the difference between QA, QC, and Testing!
